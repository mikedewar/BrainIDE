Main Aim:
Data-driven estimation of connectivity kernel before, during and on the onset of an epileptic fit.

Deliverables:
1. Familiarize with the data
2. Develop methods to identify the kernel width
3. Extend EM to estimate also the noise covariance matrices
4. Estimate the connectivity kernel, prior, on the onset and during an epileptic fit
5. Analyze of results obtained (Is there statistical significance in the differences between the estimated kernel?)
