Main Aim:
To derive and estimate from measured data a temporally second order model.

Deliverables:

1. Derive the temporally second order model
2. Apply the EM algorithm on test data generated by the model above
3. Extend the EM algorithm to estimate also the model covariances
4. Apply method above to measured data
