Reviewer 1:
###########
Major:
------
1- Compare with Mikes work and clarify the differences
 Differences:
- Non-linearity
- Spatially coloured noise
- Full model is used to generate the data and reduced model is used for estimation

2- 

i- Reference or proof for Shannon's sampling theorem 
ii- clarify the relation with Kens work

3- 

i- Only simulated data is used
ii- How the model relates to epilepsy

Minor:
------
1- The number of basis functions for decomposition and why?

2- Issues with Observation equation

3- Compare the estimation Scheme with Mikes work
 Difference: URTS-smoother instead of Standard Kalman smoother

4- Issues with boundary condition 
 
i- Explain the relevant physical implications of this choice
ii- What is the class of boundary conditions that we can use

5- 

i- What data will we use in practice (EP, SSR)?
ii- This sentence is not clear on Page 2: 'we derive the mathematical formula to create the model'

Reviewer 2:
###########
Major:
------
1- 

i- Cite other works (Kalman filtering for the estimation of neural mass models from data)
ii- Discuss the discretization issues

2- Cite other works (Forward Problem to the IDE- also check the Dynamic EM by Friston)

3- Cite other works (The inverse problem for neural fields)

4- Cite Stoffer and Shumway work

5- Compare our decomposition with Nunez and Jirsa spherical harmonic decomposition

6- Observation equation (lead field and amplifier characteristics)

Reviewer 3:
###########
Major:
------
1- Use a wider parameter space or real data or reframe and clarify the objectives of the paper

2- Comment on the performance of the model on real data and when the spatial kernel takes another form

3- 

i-Cite other works (Models and techniques for estimating neural field model parameters)
ii-Explain why we use Gaussians instead of a single expotential basis

4- Cite other works (Spatial analysis)
5- Sigmoid parameters are not realistic

Minor:
------
1- Observation equation

2- Xi estimates are outside the distribution.

3- How will it work with evoked potential paradigm?

4- 1/f^2 scaling for EEG
